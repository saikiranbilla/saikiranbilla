## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

> *Bridging the gap between AI innovation and practical applications*

Currently pursuing my Master's in Information Management (Data Science & Analytics) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm deeply passionate about developing advanced AI systems, particularly focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and building intelligent full-stack applications. 

My experience spans the entire tech stack‚Äîfrom designing sophisticated ML models and RAG architectures to implementing responsive front-end interfaces and scalable back-end systems. I believe in creating technology that solves real-world problems while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

## üß† AI & LLM Expertise

I specialize in developing cutting-edge AI solutions with a particular focus on:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Fine-tuning and prompt engineering for specific domains
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Building knowledge-grounded systems with reduced hallucinations
- **Vector Databases**: FAISS, Pinecone, and embedding optimization for semantic search
- **AI-Powered Applications**: Creating end-to-end solutions that leverage the latest in AI research

My recent work has achieved a 38% reduction in hallucination rates and 92.4% query accuracy through custom prompt engineering and advanced RAG architectures.
